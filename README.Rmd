# Introduction
The **glottospace** package facilitates the geospatial analysis of linguistic and cultural data. The aim of this package is to provide a streamlined workflow for working with spatio-linguistic data, including data import, cleaning, exploration, visualization and export. For example, with **glottospace** you can quickly match your own linguistic data to a location and plot it on a map. You can also calculate distances between languages based on their location or linguistic features and visualize those distances. In addition, with **glottospace** you can easily access global databases such as [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) and [WALS](https://wals.info/) from R and integrate them with your own data. 

# Development
We're still actively developing the **glottospace** package by adding new functions and improving existing ones. Although the package is stable, you might find bugs or encounter things you might find confusing. You can help to improve the package by:

- Sending an email to [Sietze Norder](mailto:s.j.norder@hum.leidenuniv.nl) with a clear description of the issue or error message.  
- Opening a new issue in the [glottospace issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/SietzeN/glottospace/issues)

# Citation
We're currently writing a paper about the package presenting its full functionality. If you find the **glottospace** package useful, please cite it in your work:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
citation("glottospace")
```

The package uses two global databases: [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) and [WALS](https://wals.info/). In addition, **glottospace** builds on a combination of [spatial](https://www.r-pkg.org/ctv/Spatial) and non-spatial packages, including **sf**, **terra**, **tmap**, **mapview**, **rnaturalearth**, and **dplyr**. If you use **glottospace** in one of your publications, please cite these data sources and packages as well. 

# Installation

You can install the development version of glottospace from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SietzeN/glottospace", INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))
```
# Example
Before describing the functionality of **glottospace**, we give a quick demonstration of a typical workflow. 

## Plotting language locations on a map
Imagine you're working with languages in a particular region, and want to visualize them on a map. With glottospace this is easy! You could for example filter all languages in South America, and show which ones of them are isolate languages:

```{r example_glottomap}
library(glottospace)

## Plot point data:
glottomap(continent = "South America", color = "isolate")
```

Languages are often represented with points, while in reality the speakers of a language can inhabit vast areas. glottospace works with point and polygon data. When polygon data is not available, you can interpolate the points and plot those. 

```{r example_glottopols}
## Filter by continent
glottopoints <- glottofilter(continent = "South America")
# Interpolate points to polygons:
glottopols <- glottospace(glottopoints, method = "voronoi")
# Plot polygon data:
glottomap(glottodata = glottopols, color = "family_size_rank")

```

# Workflow of glottospace

The glottospace package offers a wide range of functions to work with spatio-linguistic data. The functions are organized into the following function families, of which the core function generally has the same name as the family to which it belongs: 

1. glottoget: download glottodata from remote server, or load locally stored glottodata.
1. glottocreate: create empty glottodata structure, to add data manually. 
1. glottocheck: run interactive quality checks of user-provided glottodata.
1. glottoclean: clean-up glottodata.
1. glottojoin: join user-provided glottodata with other (often online) datasets. 
1. glottosearch: search [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) database for languages, language families, glottocodes, etc. 
1. glottofilter: filter/subset glottodata based on linguistic and geographic features/variables.
1. glottodist: calculate differences/similarities between languages based on their features (linguistic, cultural, environmental, geographic, etc.).
1. glottoplot: visualizing differences/similarities between languages.

1. glottospace: make glottodata spatial, add coordinates, add spatial points or polygons to languages.
1. glottomap: visualize linguistic and cultural data on a map.
1. glottosave: save output generated by glottospace (data, figures, maps, etc.).

## glottoget
You can load locally stored glottodata (for example from an excel file or shapefile). The glottospace package has two built-in artificial demo datasets ("demodata" and "demosubdata"). 

``` {r glottoget}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
head(glottodata)
```

You can also load glottodata from online databases such as [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/). You can download a raw version of the data ('glottolog'), or an enriched/boosted version ('glottobase'):
``` {r glottogetbase, message = FALSE}
# Two ways to load glottobase:
data("glottobase")
glottobase <- glottoget("glottobase")
colnames(glottobase)
```

## glottocreate
You can generate empty data structures that help you to add your own data in a structured way. These data structures can be saved to your local folder by specifying a filename (not demonstrated here). 

``` {r glottocreate}
glottocreate(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), variables = 3, meta = FALSE)
```

I've specified meta = FALSE, to indicate that we want to generate a 'flat' glottodata table. However, when creating glottodata, by default, several meta tables are included:

``` {r glottocreate_meta}
glottodata_meta <- glottocreate(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), variables = 3)
summary(glottodata_meta)
```

The majority of these metatables are added for the convenience of the user. The 'structure' table is the only one that is required for some of the functions in the glottospace package. A structure table can also be added later:

``` {r glottocreate_structuretable}
glottocreate_structuretable(varnames = c("var001", "var002", "var003"))
```

More complex glottodata structures can also be generated. For example, in cases where you want to distinguish between groups within each language. 
``` {r glottocreate_subdata}
# Instead of creating a single table for all languages, you might want to create a list of tables (one table for each language)
glottocreate(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), 
                     variables = 3, groups = c("a", "b"), n = 2, meta = FALSE)
```

## glottocheck
If you have your own data, you might want to do some interactive quality checks:

``` {r glottocheck}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottocheck(glottodata, diagnostic = FALSE)
```
I've now specified diagnostic = FALSE, but the default is to show some more extensive diagnostics (like a data coverage plot). 

You can also check the metadata:

``` {r glottocheckmeta}
glottodata <- glottoget(glottodata = "demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottocheck(glottodata, checkmeta = TRUE)
```

## glottoclean 
Once you've loaded glottodata, you might encounter some inconsistencies. For example, data-contributors might not have used a standardized way of coding missing values.

``` {r glottoclean}
glottodata <- glottoget(glottodata = "demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottodata$structure
# glottodata <- glottoclean(glottodata)
```

## glottojoin
Join user-provided glottodata with other datasets, or with online databases.
``` {r glottojoin}
# Join with glottospace
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottodatabase <- glottojoin(glottodata, with = "glottobase")
glottodataspace <- glottojoin(glottodata, with = "glottospace")

# Join a list of glottodata tables into a single table
glottodatalist <- glottocreate(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), 
                                       variables = 3, groups = c("a", "b"), n = 2, meta = FALSE)
glottodatatable <- glottojoin(glottodata = glottodatalist)

```

## glottosearch 
As demonstrated in the example above, you can search glottodata for a specific search term

You can search for a match in all columns:

```{r glottosearch1}
glottosearch(search = "yurakar")
```

Or limit the search to specific columns:

``` {r glottosearch2}
glottosearch(search = "Yucuni", columns = c("name", "family"))

```

Let's view one of them on [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/):

```{r example_online}
glottocode("yucu1253")
```



Sometimes you don't find a match:
```{r glottosearch3}
glottosearch(search = "matsigenka")[,"name"]
```

If you can't find what you're looking for, you can increase the tolerance:
```{r glottosearch4}
glottosearch(search = "matsigenka", tolerance = 0.2)[,"name"]
```

Aha! There it is: 'Machiguenga'
```{r glottosearch5}
glottosearch(search = "matsigenka", tolerance = 0.4)[,"name"]
```




## glottofilter
filter, select, query

```{r glottofilter}
eurasia <- glottofilter(continent = c("Europe", "Asia"))
wari <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, glottocode = "wari1268")
indo_european <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, family = 'Indo-European')
south_america <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, continent = "South America")
colovenz <- glottofilter(country = c("Colombia", "Venezuela"))
# arawtuca <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, expression = family %in% c("Arawakan", "Tucanoan"))

```


## glottodist
Quantify differences and similarities between languages
glottodistances: calculating similarities between languages based on linguistic/cultural features
```{r glottodist}
# In order to be able to calculate linguistic distances a structure table is required, that's why I specify meta = TRUE.
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottodist <- glottodist(glottodata = glottodata)

# As we've seen above, in case you have glottodata without a structure table, you can add it:
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = FALSE)
structure <- glottocreate_structuretable()
glottodata <- glottocreate_addtable(glottodata, structure, name = "structure")
```

## glottoplot
Visualizing differences (distances) between languages based on linguistic, cultural, and environmental features. 

```{r glottoplot}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottodist <- glottodist(glottodata = glottodata)
glottoplot(glottodist = glottodist)
```


## glottospace
This family of functions turns glottodata into a spatial object. As I've illustrated above, these can be either glottopoints or glottopols

```{r glottospace}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottospacedata <- glottospace(glottodata, method = "buffer", radius = 5)
# By default, the projection of maps is equal area, and shape is not preserved:
glottomap(glottospacedata)
```


## glottomap 

With glottomap you can quickly visualize the location of languages. Below I show simple static maps, but you can also create dynamic maps by specifying type = "dynamic".

You can pass arguments directly to glottofilter

```{r glottomap}
glottomap(country = "Colombia")
```

However, you can also create maps with other glottodata. For example, we might want to create a world map highlighting the largest language families

```{r}
glottodata <- glottoget()
families <- dplyr::count(glottodata, family, sort = TRUE)

# highlight 10 largest families:
glottodata <- glottospotlight(glottodata = glottodata, spotcol = "family", spotlight = families$family[1:10], spotcontrast = "family", bgcontrast = "family")

# Create map
glottomap(glottodata, color = "color")
```


## glottosave 
All output generated with the glottospace package (data, figures, maps, etc.) can be saved with a single command. 

```{r glottoworldmap}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = FALSE)
# Saves as .xlsx
# glottosave(glottodata, filename = "glottodata") 

# Saves as .GPKG
glottospacedata <- glottospace(glottodata)
# glottosave(glottodata, filename = "glottodata") 

# By default, static maps are saved as .png, dynamic maps are saved as .html
glottomap <- glottomap(glottodata)
# glottosave(glottomap, filename = "glottomap") 
```
